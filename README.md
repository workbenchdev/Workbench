> My favorite tool is definitely Workbench, an application that allows me to compose GTK interfaces with XML/Blueprint, JavaScript, and CSS, seeing the results in real-time. This tool has simplified my life by reducing my time drastically. It is an essential tool for those who develop applications with GTK and I recommend it even to those who are new to GTK.

> GSoC coding period started on Monday, so this is a good time to blog about what I‚Äôve started working on and what‚Äôs my milestone to finish the project. First off, I‚Äôve created a simple mockup using Sonny Piers‚Äô amazing Workbench app. This is the first step in knowing how we want the UI to look like, at least in the first iteration.
