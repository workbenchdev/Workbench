## Tips and tricks

<details>
  <summary>Disable code formatting</summary>

Workbench uses the [prettier](https://prettier.io/) code formatter. If you need to exclude some code you can use special comments.

[JavaScript](https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html#javascript)

```js
// prettier-ignore
matrix(
  1, 0, 0,
  0, 1, 0,
  0, 0, 1
);
```

[CSS](https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html#css)

```css
/* prettier-ignore */
.my    ugly rule
{

}
```

<details>
  <summary>Turn a prototype made in Workbench into an application</summary>

Use GNOME Builder to start a new project using the appropriate GNOME Application template and copy paste your Workbench code.

> My favorite tool is definitely Workbench, an application that allows me to compose GTK interfaces with XML/Blueprint, JavaScript, and CSS, seeing the results in real-time. This tool has simplified my life by reducing my time drastically. It is an essential tool for those who develop applications with GTK and I recommend it even to those who are new to GTK.

> GSoC coding period started on Monday, so this is a good time to blog about what I‚Äôve started working on and what‚Äôs my milestone to finish the project. First off, I‚Äôve created a simple mockup using Sonny Piers‚Äô amazing Workbench app. This is the first step in knowing how we want the UI to look like, at least in the first iteration.
